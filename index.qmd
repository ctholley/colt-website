Hello, welcome to my little personal website! My name is Colt Holley. I am a fisheries research scientist focused on open-source reproducible science for the conservation and management of Pacific salmon and steelhead. Through the R programming language and helpful extensions (RStudio, Tidyverse, etc.), I build analytical tools, data pipelines, and other nerdy things.
